    <p class="heading">The current state of Indonesia</p>
    <p>
      Over 270 million people in Indonesia use energy every day. That’s why it’s
      important to make sure that the energy is produced cleanly. Currently,
      Indonesia doesn’t do so well. In 2022, Indonesia used a total of 25328 TW.
      This is a lot of energy, unfortunately, only 7% of this energy was
      produced by renewable means. So what is holding Indonesia back from
      producing clean energy?
    </p>
    <p>Let's find out in the next few dimensions.</p>
    <p class="heading">Spatial dimensions</p>
    <p>
      Indonesia is made up of three main islands. Java, Sumatra and Borneo
      island. Out of these three, Sumatra is the most densely populated. Java
      and Borneo are both densely forested and don’t have a big population.
      Borneo Island is mostly flat, the northern side of the island is
      mountainous. Java Island is flat on the east and mountainous on the west.
      Sumatra island is mostly mountainous with some spots of flat land. The
      land on Borneo Island is mostly used for palm oil production. The land on
      Java is mostly used for agriculture such as soybeans and rice. The land in
      Sumatra has most of the big cities. This is where most of the business is
      done. But there is also some agriculture being done on the island.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Socio-cultural dimensions</p>
    <p>
      Indonesian culture is focused on the community, with a hierarchical
      structure. Indonesians believe in the concept of going royong (mutual
      assistance) and mufakat (consensus), and the national motto is Bhinneka
      Tunggal Ika (Unity in diversity). The population of Indonesia is around
      300 million people. The birth rate is 16.817 per 1000 people and the death
      rate is 10.060. The growth rate is 1.63 per cent. Migration is not very
      big in Indonesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around 40.12 per cent of Indonesians aged 15 years and above had completed
      senior high school or more. Compulsory education in Indonesia begins at
      age seven and lasts a total of nine years. During this time, public
      schooling is offered at no cost. A minimum of one year of Indonesian
      language study is required if a child is to graduate from high school.
    </p>
    <p>To have a more sustainable country more people should go to school.</p>

    <p class="heading">Political dimensions</p>
    <p>
      Indonesia is a democratic country and its capitalistic. The president is
      Joko Widodo. He is part of the Indonesian democratic party of Struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indonesia has trade pacts with Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand,
      Chile, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey,
      Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Mozambique, China and India.
    </p>
    <p>Indonesia has political pacts.</p>
    <p>Indonesia has a civil law system based on the Roman-Dutch model.</p>

    <p class="heading">Economical dimensions</p>
    <p>
      The GDP of Indonesia is $1.39 trillion (nominal; 2023 est.) and $4.39
      trillion (PPP; 2023 est.) Indonesia has a large and in many cases
      unprospected, variety of mineral deposits. Mining, including the
      extraction of oil and natural gas, accounts for roughly one-tenth of the
      country's GDP, and through exports and taxation, it contributes
      substantially to foreign-exchange earnings and development.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Physical dimensions</p>
    <p>
      There is a lot of activity in Indonesia regarding earthquakes so a high
      risk and throw a spanner in the works. So you can’t build elaborate
      buildings. The most fertile soil is near the volcanoes. But the best soil
      for building loam is in west Papua and there is also low volcanic activity
      so there is the best place for constructing a geothermal power plant.
      because it’s very hot and humid so good conditions for plants to grow,
      that makes the plants grow very dense and it becomes a jungle so they need
      to be cut down to build the projects. The abundance of trees also gives a
      good opportunity for the biomass industry and because Indonesia ships
      biomass they can also turn it into energy themself.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      The best energy source to use in Indonesia differs per island. In Java, it
      is a good idea to use geothermal energy combined with solar energy. We
      will be able to use geothermal energy as the island’s geothermal energy is
      easy to access. This is because of the number of volcanoes on the island.
      One downside of geothermal power plants is that they are pricy and hard to
      install. This is why it’s a good idea to combine power plants with solar
      power. On the eastern side of the island, there is a lot of potential for
      solar energy. Installing a solar park will be easy and will cost less than
      geothermal power plants. The energy retrieved from this park will be
      enough to supply power to eastern Java and Bali. Moving on to Sumatra.
      Sumatra is less populated and therefore requires less energy to be
      produced. As for the options for Java, there aren’t many. Biomass will be
      able to generate a lot of energy. This is a good option because Sumatra is
      densely forested. On the other hand, biomass is not a very green solution.
      Sumatra’s jungle has already been exploited for years for its trees to
      generate biomass energy. That’s why we believe that geothermal and
      hydropower are better alternatives. Both of these are possible as Sumatra
      is geothermally active and has rivers running through it which can be used
      to generate energy with hydropower stations. Lastly, we have Borneo Borneo
      island is the least populated of the three that we will discuss. Despite
      its population density, there are still some big cities on the island. The
      best option for these cities is hydropower and solar power. Biomass won’t
      be considered because of the same reason as discussed with Sumatra, it
      harms the environment. Hydropower is a good option as there are a lot of
      rivers that flow through the island. Although building a dam to generate
      this power is expensive. The other option is to build solar parks. These
      are way easier to build than hydropower centrals. They also cost less. The
      only problem with these is that a lot of space has to be cleared out for
      the panels. This could lead to further deforestation. So we now have
      discussed the best means of generating energy on the three main islands.
      For Java it is geothermal and solar power, for Sumatra it is geothermal
      energy and hydropower. And finally, for Borneo, it is Hydropower and solar
      power.
