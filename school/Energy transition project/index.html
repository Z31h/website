    <p class="heading">The current state of Indonesia</p>
    <p>
      Over 270 million people in Indonesia use energy every day. That’s why it’s
      important to make sure that the energy is produced cleanly. Currently,
      Indonesia doesn’t do so well. In 2022, Indonesia used a total of 25328 TW.
      This is a lot of energy, unfortunately, only 7% of this energy was
      produced by renewable means. So what is holding Indonesia back from
      producing clean energy?
    </p>
    <p>Let's find out in the next few dimensions.</p>
    <p class="heading">Spatial dimensions</p>
    <p>
      Indonesia is made up of three main islands. Java, Sumatra and Borneo
      island. Out of these three, Sumatra is the most densely populated. Java
      and Borneo are both densely forested and don’t have a big population.
      Borneo Island is mostly flat, the northern side of the island is
      mountainous. Java Island is flat on the east and mountainous on the west.
      Sumatra island is mostly mountainous with some spots of flat land. The
      land on Borneo Island is mostly used for palm oil production. The land on
      Java is mostly used for agriculture such as soybeans and rice. The land in
      Sumatra has most of the big cities. This is where most of the business is
      done. But there is also some agriculture being done on the island.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Socio-cultural dimensions</p>
    <p>
      Indonesian culture is focused on the community, with a hierarchical
      structure. Indonesians believe in the concept of going royong (mutual
      assistance) and mufakat (consensus), and the national motto is Bhinneka
      Tunggal Ika (Unity in diversity). The population of Indonesia is around
      300 million people. The birth rate is 16.817 per 1000 people and the death
      rate is 10.060. The growth rate is 1.63 per cent. Migration is not very
      big in Indonesia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around 40.12 per cent of Indonesians aged 15 years and above had completed
      senior high school or more. Compulsory education in Indonesia begins at
      age seven and lasts a total of nine years. During this time, public
      schooling is offered at no cost. A minimum of one year of Indonesian
      language study is required if a child is to graduate from high school.
    </p>
    <p>To have a more sustainable country more people should go to school.</p>

    <p class="heading">Political dimensions</p>
    <p>
      Indonesia is a democratic country and its capitalistic. The president is
      Joko Widodo. He is part of the Indonesian democratic party of Struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indonesia has trade pacts with Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand,
      Chile, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey,
      Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Mozambique, China and India.
    </p>
    <p>Indonesia has political pacts.</p>
    <p>Indonesia has a civil law system based on the Roman-Dutch model.</p>

    <p class="heading">Economical dimensions</p>
    <p>
      The GDP of Indonesia is $1.39 trillion (nominal; 2023 est.) and $4.39
      trillion (PPP; 2023 est.) Indonesia has a large and in many cases
      unprospected, variety of mineral deposits. Mining, including the
      extraction of oil and natural gas, accounts for roughly one-tenth of the
      country's GDP, and through exports and taxation, it contributes
      substantially to foreign-exchange earnings and development.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Physical dimensions</p>
    <p>
      There is a lot of activity in Indonesia regarding earthquakes so a high
      risk and throw a spanner in the works. So you can’t build elaborate
      buildings. The most fertile soil is near the volcanoes. But the best soil
      for building loam is in west Papua and there is also low volcanic activity
      so there is the best place for constructing a geothermal power plant.
      because it’s very hot and humid so good conditions for plants to grow,
      that makes the plants grow very dense and it becomes a jungle so they need
      to be cut down to build the projects. The abundance of trees also gives a
      good opportunity for the biomass industry and because Indonesia ships
      biomass they can also turn it into energy themself.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Explanation</p>
    <p>
      Indonesia generates energy mostly from coal and oil. Over 60% of all its
      energy is generated this way. Producing energy with geothermal central is
      way better than generating energy with coal and oil. The earth will always
      be geothermally active for as long as we will exist. That is not the case
      with coal or oil, both of those are finite. Another reason why geothermal
      energy is superior is that it doesn’t emit any greenhouse gasses during
      its production. This, of course, isn’t the case with coal and oil.
      Geothermal uses the heat of deep in the earth to turn water into steam and
      make it into steam. where you can have the steam drive turbines that
      generate electricity. Solar power is also a good solution for Java and
      Borneo. Because Borneo exports all kinds of natural resources. It is quite
      rich. Java is the richest island of them all having the capital city and a
      great touristic place. The best place to put solar panels is to put them
      in lakes or in cutdown forests and use that surplus of wood for the
      biomass industry. Indonesia is already a big exporter of biomass materials
      to other countries. But cutting down huge chunks of forests is a bad idea.
      Indonesia already started experimenting with solar parks on lakes, so this
      can be something to do again. On a bigger scale. Solar panels have cells
      in them that can convert sunlight into energy Hydropower works at the end
      of the rivers in lower laying areas. Placing a dam and generating
      electricity and having more control over the water. It can be dangerous to
      go tampering with the rivers because many people rely on them for fishing
      and building dams could be a disaster. There is a turbine located in the
      dam that gets turned around by the flowing water and a dynamo turning the
      motion of the turbine into energy.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Costs</p>
    <p>
      Indonesia used 291 Terawatt hours in 2021. Java uses 67% of the total
      energy. That makes 291*0.63=194.97 Terawatt hours. On average, a
      geothermal power plant generates 100GWh per year. This means that we will
      need 1950 geothermal power plants to power all of Java. This will cost
      487.5 billion dollars. Of course, isn’t practical or economically
      beneficial. That’s why we need to balance the geothermal power plants with
      solar power plants. On average, a solar power plant can produce 1.8 mWh
      per m2 per year. A reasonably sized solar park is around 15000m2. This
      will make our solar power plant produce 30 GWh per year. One square meter
      of solar panels costs around 10 dollars. This means that one entire park
      will cost 150 million dollars. Java will need 6500 solar power plants to
      power the entirety of Java. This will cost 975 billion dollars. Of course
      assumes, this that all of Java will run on green energy. However, this
      change is almost impossible to make within a reasonable amount of time.
      That’s why I think that it’s best if Java increases its renewable energy
      to 30%. This change will cost Java 130 billion dollars. Sumatra consumes
      15% of Indonesia’s total energy which makes the island’s power consumption
      in 2021 43.65 TWh. We have already calculated that one geothermal power
      plant generates 100GWh per year and costs 250 million dollars. This means
      that we will need 437 power plants to generate all the energy for Sumatra.
      This will cost 110 billion dollars. We can also generate energy with
      hydropower. One plant generates 4 TWh and costs 5 million dollars. This
      means that it will take 11 hydropower plants to power all of Sumatra. This
      will cost only 55 million dollars. In order not to be fully dependent on
      hydropower, we still think it’s a good idea to install some geothermal
      power plants as well. That is why we will only install 10 hydropower
      plants. This will cost 50 million dollars and will generate 40Twh of
      energy. Meanwhile, we will have to install 37 geothermal plants. This will
      cost 9.5 billion dollars. This means that with just 9555 million dollars,
      Sumatra will only be using renewable energy. Borneo consumes 11% of
      Indonesia’s total energy which makes the island’s power consumption in
      2021 32.01 TWh. Borneo Island will use solar parks and hydropower plants
      to generate its energy. One hydropower plant costs 5 million dollars and
      produces 4 TWh. One solar park costs 150 million dollars and produces 30
      GWh on average. If we install 8 hydropower plants on the island, it will
      cost us 40 million dollars to power almost the entire island. The
      remaining energy needed can be generated with solar parks. This will cost
      us 14 million dollars, so in total 54 million dollars to get the entire
      island onto renewable energy.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>
    <p>
      The best energy source to use in Indonesia differs per island. In Java, it
      is a good idea to use geothermal energy combined with solar energy. We
      will be able to use geothermal energy as the island’s geothermal energy is
      easy to access. This is because of the number of volcanoes on the island.
      One downside of geothermal power plants is that they are pricy and hard to
      install. This is why it’s a good idea to combine power plants with solar
      power. On the eastern side of the island, there is a lot of potential for
      solar energy. Installing a solar park will be easy and will cost less than
      geothermal power plants. The energy retrieved from this park will be
      enough to supply power to eastern Java and Bali. Moving on to Sumatra.
      Sumatra is less populated and therefore requires less energy to be
      produced. As for the options for Java, there aren’t many. Biomass will be
      able to generate a lot of energy. This is a good option because Sumatra is
      densely forested. On the other hand, biomass is not a very green solution.
      Sumatra’s jungle has already been exploited for years for its trees to
      generate biomass energy. That’s why we believe that geothermal and
      hydropower are better alternatives. Both of these are possible as Sumatra
      is geothermally active and has rivers running through it which can be used
      to generate energy with hydropower stations. Lastly, we have Borneo Borneo
      island is the least populated of the three that we will discuss. Despite
      its population density, there are still some big cities on the island. The
      best option for these cities is hydropower and solar power. Biomass won’t
      be considered because of the same reason as discussed with Sumatra, it
      harms the environment. Hydropower is a good option as there are a lot of
      rivers that flow through the island. Although building a dam to generate
      this power is expensive. The other option is to build solar parks. These
      are way easier to build than hydropower centrals. They also cost less. The
      only problem with these is that a lot of space has to be cleared out for
      the panels. This could lead to further deforestation. So we now have
      discussed the best means of generating energy on the three main islands.
      For Java it is geothermal and solar power, for Sumatra it is geothermal
      energy and hydropower. And finally, for Borneo, it is Hydropower and solar
      power.
